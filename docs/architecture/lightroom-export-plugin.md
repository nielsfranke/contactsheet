# Lightroom export plugin

**Status:** **proposed.** No code yet. The server-side prerequisite is **already
shipped** — the generic personal-access-token (PAT) mechanism (migration `0041`)
that the [Capture One export plugin](./captureone-export-plugin.md) introduced was
built non-C1-specific exactly so Lightroom (and scripts/CI) could reuse it. The
MVP upload flow needs **zero backend work**; only the optional two-way "read picks
back" phase needs a small, additive endpoint.

> This note follows the same split as the C1 plugin: the **plugin lives in its own
> permissively-licensed repo** (e.g. `contactsheet-lightroom`); the only thing that
> ever lands in *this* (AGPL) repo is the optional readback endpoint in Phase 2.

## Goal

Let a photographer publish selected photos **straight from Lightroom Classic into a
ContactSheet gallery** — pick (or create) a gallery, hit publish, and Lightroom
renders the RAWs per the user's export settings and uploads the finished files.
No "export to folder → drag into the web uploader" round-trip.

Same clean division of labour as Capture One: **Lightroom does the rendering**
(RAW → JPEG/TIFF, resize, sharpening, watermark — from the user's export settings),
the plugin only **uploads the rendered files** to ContactSheet's existing REST API.

## Why Lightroom is the *easier and richer* target than Capture One

Everything that made the C1 plugin friction-heavy disappears, and the Publish
Service model offers more than C1's publish API.

| | Capture One | **Lightroom Classic** |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Obj-C/Swift **+** C# — two codebases | **Lua, one codebase** for macOS + Windows |
| Distribution | `.coplugin`, **Apple notarisation**, Developer Program | `.lrplugin` folder, **no signing/notarisation**, zip & ship |
| SDK access | gated signup + proprietary EULA | **free, openly documented**, no gate |
| Publish model | render → hand off | **Publish Service** with change-tracking |

- **One Lua codebase, both OSes.** The C1 note's biggest open cost (two native
  codebases, macOS-first, Windows "later") is gone.
- **No Apple Developer Program, no notarisation, no proprietary EULA.** An
  `.lrplugin` is a plain folder of Lua. The three C1 "open questions" (EULA wording,
  notarisation, $99/yr) **do not exist here**.
- **Publish Service ≠ plain export.** Lightroom's `LrPublishService` provider keeps
  a persistent mapping of *published photo → remote ID/URL*, detects edits
  ("Modified Photos to Re-Publish"), and can sync deletions. We get real
  **incremental sync** instead of blind re-upload.

**Target = Lightroom Classic.** Lightroom (cloud / "CC") has **no local plugin SDK**
of this kind — only a remote REST API and a different workflow. Out of scope.

## How a Lightroom publish plugin works

A `.lrplugin` bundle whose `Info.lua` registers an **Export Service Provider** with
publishing enabled (`supportsIncrementalPublish = true`). Key pieces:

- **`Info.lua`** — manifest: SDK version, the service-provider script, plugin
  metadata fields (where we store the per-photo remote ID).
- **Service provider (Lua):**
  - `sectionsForTopOfDialog` / export settings UI via `LrView` — instance URL,
    token, gallery picker (existing / create).
  - `processRenderedPhotos(functionContext, exportContext)` — Lightroom hands us
    each **rendered** temp file; we `POST` it. Progress via `exportContext` scope.
  - Publish hooks: `getCollectionBehaviorInfo`, `imposeSortOrderOnPublishedCollection`,
    deletion via `deletePhotosFromPublishedCollection`.
- **HTTP:** `LrHttp.postMultipart` for uploads, `LrTasks` for async, `LrErrors`
  for failure surfacing.
- **Token storage:** Lightroom has no OS-keychain API; store the PAT in plugin
  prefs (`LrPrefs`). Documented caveat — same trust model as any LrPrefs-stored
  credential (Lightroom's own service plugins do this). Optionally offer the macOS
  Keychain via a small `security`-CLI shell-out; decide in Phase 1.

## Server side: nothing new for the MVP

The PAT mechanism (`require_scope` in `auth/dependencies.py`) already fronts exactly
the three endpoints the plugin needs, admitting a `Bearer cs_pat_…` whose `scopes`
include the required one:

| Plugin action | Endpoint | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Populate gallery picker | `GET /api/galleries` | `galleries:read` (list-only) |
| Create gallery on publish | `POST /api/galleries` | `galleries:write` |
| Upload rendered photo | `POST /api/galleries/{id}/images` | `images:write` |

The photographer mints a token in ContactSheet admin
(`/admin/settings/api-tokens`), pastes **instance URL + token** into the plugin,
done. **No new upload/gallery endpoints.**

## Auth flow

1. Photographer creates a PAT in ContactSheet admin, copies the copy-once secret.
2. Plugin settings: paste instance URL + token → stored in `LrPrefs` (see caveat
   above).
3. Plugin calls `GET /api/galleries` (Bearer) for the picker, `POST /api/galleries`
   to create, `POST /api/galleries/{id}/images` to upload each rendered file.

Error mapping to surface in Lightroom: `401` (bad/expired token → re-auth prompt),
`413` (file too large), moderation/`client_upload` cases, network/`5xx` (retry).

## Phase 2 — read client picks back into Lightroom (the differentiator)

Lightroom can write per-photo metadata, so the publish plugin can pull each photo's
ContactSheet engagement (color flag / like / star rating) and reflect it as a
**Lightroom color label or star rating**. This is the picdrop/CloudSpot "review →
back to my catalog" workflow, and it's where Lightroom's publish model beats C1's.

**This is the one piece of backend work**, because the current read scope is
deliberately list-only:

- `galleries:read` today grants only `GET /api/galleries` (the picker list).
- A single gallery's contents — `GET /api/galleries/{gallery_id}` and
  `GET /api/galleries/{gallery_id}/images` — are **`get_current_admin` only**
  (verified in `routers/galleries.py`), so a PAT cannot read picks.

**Proposed additive change (AGPL, this repo):** a narrow, token-readable projection
of per-image review state for one gallery — e.g. `GET
/api/galleries/{id}/images/picks` gated by a **new `images:read` scope**, returning
only `{image_id, filename, color_flag, rating, like_count}` (no comments, no PII, no
full library enumeration). Keeps the "read token = small blast radius" principle:
list-galleries and read-one-gallery's-picks are separate scopes, neither exposes the
whole library or any other gallery's contents. New scope is additive — no schema
change (scopes are JSON), existing tokens unaffected.

Mapping in the plugin: ContactSheet color flag → LR color label; star rating →
LR rating; configurable, opt-in (don't clobber the photographer's own labels
silently).

## Repo & licence

The **plugin lives in its own repo** (e.g. `contactsheet-lightroom`, Forgejo
primary + GitHub push-mirror, matching the main project + the C1 plugin), licensed
**MIT/Apache-2.0** — not AGPL. Same reasoning as the C1 note: the plugin is an
independent HTTP client containing no ContactSheet source, AGPL §13 (network use)
binds the *server* not a client, and it tracks the **Lightroom SDK**'s cadence, not
ContactSheet releases. Lightroom's SDK is not linked as a proprietary binary
framework (it's a Lua host), so the licence story is even cleaner than C1's.

The **optional Phase-2 `images:read` endpoint stays in this repo (AGPL)** — the only
coupling point, and only if we do readback.

## Rollout phases

1. **Plugin MVP (new MIT repo):** `.lrplugin` with settings (URL + token), gallery
   picker (existing/create), `processRenderedPhotos` upload with progress + error
   handling (401 / 413 / moderation). **No backend work.**
2. **Publish Service semantics:** persistent published-collection mapping
   (store remote image ID in plugin metadata), re-publish on edit, deletion sync.
3. **Phase 2 readback (small AGPL backend add + plugin):** `images:read` scope +
   `…/images/picks` endpoint; map ContactSheet flags/ratings → LR labels/stars.
4. **Distribution:** zip the `.lrplugin`, install docs; optional listing on
   Adobe Exchange later.

## Decisions to confirm

- **Token storage:** `LrPrefs` (simple, matches other LR plugins) vs. macOS
  Keychain shell-out (more secure, macOS-only). Lean `LrPrefs` for the MVP.
- **Phase-2 readback:** ship it, and is `images:read` the right granularity (vs.
  reusing/ widening `galleries:read`)? Keeping it a *separate* scope is the safer
  default.
- **Gallery UX:** create-on-publish, pick-existing, or both; target sub-gallery?
  (mirrors the same open question in the C1 note).
- **Lightroom Classic only** — confirm we're not chasing Lightroom cloud (no SDK).
